# Cone Bot for Discord

Functionally identical to [Orange Cone](https://github.com/gearysw/orangecone), adapted for use in Discord. Uses the [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/) library.

This bot uses a `config.json` file to load environment variables. Make sure to create the file in root directory and put in the key-value pair for `prefix` and `token`.
